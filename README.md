# Telelib
This is an ESM compliant implementation of the Telegram Bot API.

Currently, Node.js can only have ES modules enabled while using the `--experimental-modules` argument when running the node executable.
You will currently need to be running a version of node that supports ESM modules.
This module was developed on the v12 branch of Node.js, and may not be compatible with older releases.
