/**
 * This object represents an incoming callback query from a callback button in an [inline keyboard](https://core.telegram.org/bots#inline-keyboards-and-on-the-fly-updating). If the button that originated the query was attached to a message sent by the bot, the field *message* will be present. If the button was attached to a message sent via the bot (in [inline mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inline-mode)), the field *inline_message_id* will be present. Exactly one of the fields data or *game_short_name* will be present.
 *
 * >**NOTE:** After the user presses a callback button, Telegram clients will display a progress bar until you call [answerCallbackQuery](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#answercallbackquery). It is, therefore, necessary to react by calling [answerCallbackQuery](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#answercallbackquery) even if no notification to the user is needed (e.g., without specifying any of the optional parameters).
